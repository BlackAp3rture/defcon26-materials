* scan network for all Crestron devices, parse response data, try to connect to the CTP console of every device found, and run WHOAMI command
```
USAGE: ./demo1_scanning.rb
```
### demo2_mc3_shell.rb
* use backdoor account to escape CTP sandbox and open debug shell on vulnerable MC3 devices
```

```
USAGE: ./demo2_tsw_shell.rb [target_ip]
```
### demo2_tsw_unshell.rb
* undo what was done by demo2_tsw_shell.rb (reboot of target device required afterward)
```
USAGE: ./demo2_tsw_unshell.rb [target_ip]
```
### demo3_spying.rb
* use command injection vuln to modify a system config file on a vulnerable TSW device and restart a service to enable RTSP streaming
* also, automatically opens vlc to view the RTSP stream
```
